# Return To Chaos (RTC) Data Extractor
A tool to extract the binary files from rtc files

## A quick bit about this:
So currently, it decodes and decompresses the data allowing you to dump the files into an output dir

## How to use?

`RTCExtractor.exe "C:\Games\RTC\Modules\EoB (49).RTC" "C:\_temp\eobout3"`

This will create a directory at c:\_temp\eobout3

And start extracting the files from there.

## What next

Well probably not alot unless there is a demand for it, I just wanted the graphics out.

It currently does not store the file names as like for like in the .txt version of a mod file.
That would be my next job.

Maybe the dungeon data? and the party data?
